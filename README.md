Sample code from my horror game in VR, where you have to pick up and deliver flasks in a zombie infested facility.

there are 2 of my scripts :
 - FlashLightBattery.cs : handles the battery consumption and the lighting modes of the flashlight
 
 - FlaskDetection.cs : handles the detection of the flasks the user is bringing to the lobby and updates the environment
